            For this project, the goal is to make a low poly character that has a rig to be able to be animated easily 
            and to be used for many different projects like games or animations. The low poly character will be a strong character 
            wielding a blade or even a shield which will be rigged with the character. It will help me understand
            how to have two different models in a character and also a way to choreograph fight scene animations in the future.

        <p>
            My End Users are people aged 13-16 years. Teens would like a simple and easy low poly character that wields a
            weapon used for their projects that includes fighting or an RPG game. Because it wields a weapon, these
            teens would find ways to be creative and a way to use the weapon in their projects. this low poly character will
            aim to teenagers who want their creativity to shine with what they want to see in a fighing scene. For a country, it 
            is for teens who speak english as most of the low poly instructions will be in english and will be tricky for non-english
            users to understand.

        <h1>Implications</h1>
	 <p><h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Aesthetics is about making the outcome look and feel good. </h4> 
    <br>
   The look of the character is important aesthically because it is something that
   makes my end users want to use my low poly character I created. 
   The model should not only be low poly, but resemble the models and limbs and should be
   seen as what it is meant to be. To make the limbs look like limbs, I will make the arms 
   have fingers and an elbow and the legs have a knee joint and feet. To make the character
   even more aesthetic, I can make the character have strong muscles that really shows how 
   strong the character is. The blade and shield that the character wields with should 
   have enough detail to make it look menacing and to flow with the low poly characters'
   aesthetics.
<br>

	<h3>Functionality</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Functionality is about ensuring the outcome works as its meant to.</h4> 
    <br>
    It should not be "glitchy" and and not cause any problems for my end users where they would
    most likely use it a lot for their project. Any issues would hold their project back
    and make end users less likely to use my low poly character. I will ensure it does not have glitchy
    animation by making enough animations that fit with the current scenario asm much as possible and also reviewing the 
    animation by peer reviewing and seeing what I can do to make it even more smoother or what I missed during the
    animating phase. 
<br>

	<h3>Usability</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Usability is about making the outcome easy to use. </h4>
    <br>
    Using my low poly character for your own project should be easy as for my end users. 
    I can do this by having a rig that flows and match the ligament joints of my low poly character's limbs. It should also
    be clear where the joints are so my end users know where the animation rig is going to be. For my end users who want to 
    create a game using my low poly character, the animations must be fluidly smooth and nice to look at. I can do this by
    taking my time to animate and asking for feedback on what I can do to improve upon the animation. When the animation is 
    finished, I will name the animation corresponding to what the low poly character is doing. For example, if my character
    is running, I will name it "Character_Run_1". I will do the same for all the other animations I will do like jumping, walking,
    attacking and defending. 
    
    <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
    <br>
    <h4> Something or a property owned and legally protected by the rightful Owner.</h4> 
    <br>
    My low poly character will be its own Intellectual property by making sure it is original. I will still have some
    ideas and thoughts from other models but will make a way to make it original by me. A way can I do it is by having
    a special symbol on the character that no other character has. But to protect it from others using it without my 
    permission, I will license and copyright my low poly character and everything that comes with the model.
