            For this project, the goal is to make a low poly character that has a rig to be able to be animated easily 
            and to be used for many different projects like games or animations. The low poly character will be someone 
            wielding a blade or even a shield which will be rigged with the character. It will help me understand
            how to have two different models in a character and also a way to choreograph fight scene animations in the future.

        <p>
            My End Users are people aged 13-16 years. Teens would like a simple and easy low poly character that wields a
            weapon used for their projects that includes fighting or an RPG game. Because it wields a weapon, these
            teens would find ways to be creative and a way to use the weapon in their projects. this low poly character will
            aim to teenagers who want their creativity to shine with what they want to see in a fighing scene. For a country, it 
            is for teens who speak english as most of the low poly instructions will be in english and will be tricky for non-english
            users to understand.

        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <p> <h3>Torso</h3>
            <br>
            Main part of the rig <br>
            Could have a shirt but depends so far <br>
            Model is easy to understand from another persons' view <br>
            Wearable armor can go on the Torso <br>

            <br>
            Smooth and clean animations <br>
            Un/equipping the weapons should be smooth and "realistic"<br>
            The rig should be easy to animate and no dislocating of joints <br>
            'Finisher' Animations <br>

        <h1>Implications</h1>
	 <p><h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Aesthetics is about making the outcome look and feel good. </h4> 
    <br>
   The look of the character is important aesthically because it is something that
   makes my end users want to use my low poly character I created. 
   The model should not only be low poly, but resemble the models and limbs and should be
   seen as what it is meant to be. This also helps me make the models and limbs with more
   detail as it contributes to the aesthetics and 
<br>

	<h3>Functionality</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Functionality is about ensuring the outcome works as its meant to.</h4> 
    <br>
    It should not be buggy and not cause any problems for my end users where they would
    most likely use it a lot for their project. Any issues would hold their project back
    and make end users less likely to use my low poly character. I will ensure it is not
    buggy by running as many scenarios with the rigs as possible and also reviewing the 
    code by the peer reviewing.
<br>

	<h3>Usability</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Usability is about making the outcome easy to use. </h4>
    <br>
    Using my low poly character for your own project should be easy as pie for my end users. 
    The instructions and the use of the low poly character is easy to understand and use. To 
    ensure this, I will have the rigs as simple and easy to understand with minimal buggy code.
