        <p> The arms have good form and can clearly see the muscle groups. You can also see the fingers clearly. 
            The arms are uneven and dont match with each other since the muscles are non symmetrical. - Henry

            and his jawline is too straight and isnt curving at the end from the side view. - Henry

            <p> I wanted to work on the feedback but I also want to add other stuff on the turnaround to add depth in my character.
                To add depth, I added layers of clothing and battle armor to make my character more stronger and even more intimidating.
                This makes my character look like a warrior at best. </p>

             <p> Based from feedback, the feedback mostly say to fix limb proportions so it doesn't look weird and whatnot. So what I did 
                mostly was definetely fixing the legs and arms so they are even from the frontview. The sideview looked alright based from
                what feedback.

        <p> For Modelling, I focused more on the Torso. The reason is that it is the more important part of the model, with it being 
            more noticeable than the other parts of the model. The Torso will also define the strength and power of the character.
            By doing this, I can achieve my goal of requiring a very muscular model.

        <img src="Model_images/OldModelBack.PNG" alt="Model Image - Back View Old">
             <p> For the torso, I wanted to make it look strong, so by making the points of the chest more extruded and exaggerated, 
                I can help exaggerate its muscular aura and vibe that it should give out. Then, I make the proportions slimmer to tell
            that my character is fit and strong! </p>

            chest doesn't seem too bad, but I believe I should make it more muscular instead of sharp. <br>
             From the side, not sure what I can really do, so I will request for feedback. </p>

        <p> From the front, I removed the chest that makes it look like a woman, but I kept the strength by adding a little
            bump off of it to make sure my model shows off its muscles on its chest. I also increased the stomach proportions
            a bit more as it looked like a very skinny but fit girl.

        <p> I decided that I want my animations to look smooth and fit my models style. What I went with is a running animation that makes 
            my model look smooth and swift whilst running at incredible speeds. The arms should be opposite of the leg next to it when running
            so it looks natural.
