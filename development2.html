            <p> Before the game starts, we want our user to be able to understand fully how to play the game, what the game is going to give you,
                and the basic mechanics to understand. To make sure we pull this off, we are going to add an intro as well as a tutorial and explanation
                on how all the things work. The tutorial will include what I previously mentioned and I will do all those as clear as possible.
                But we don't want the tutorial to be boring either, so what we're planning to do is to taunt our user into thinking our game is hard,
                giving them a feeling to be excited and to be pumped about the game.

            <p> Based on the feedback, I will now add another option for the input from the User where they can just
                choose the letter corresponding the action. So if Yes is A, then they can just type A and all goes well.
            This can be the same for typing B where if No was B, then B would output the "no" scenario and the same can
            also be said for the "not sure/ dunno" scenario </p>

            <p> Based on Steffen's feedback, he says there is not much I can do about it and works. The instructions are clear, but
                Jackson makes a good point. It has the same problem as the Intro Inputs where I cannot answer either A, B or C as a valid answer 
                which doesn't make it any easier for the user to play as sometimes there is a lot of dialogue and the options may 
                be incredibly long. The plan here is to add the optional inputs; that being A, B, C, or D alongside the main inputs. </p>

    <p> For our Text Adventure, we plan on adding a wild encounter with a Boar that will ruthlessly attack you and you must defend
        and attack the boar to survive the attack or to eat it or even just running away from the fight itself. Because I want to 
        make this encounter pop up in every scenario in our run, I will use the def() feature which helps the code be duplicated on
        other parts of the code without having a huge pile of code that has been copy and pasted. <br>

        The plan is to make a turn based attack system with you attacking first then the boar attacking after. The boar is clearly stronger
        than you, so you have a chance to block instead. Or you can run, whatever floats your boat. Each attack will take different amounts of damage based off 
        the attack you do from 3 options. This can be said the same for your health as well by defending and depending on what type of defense you do, the amount of 
        damage will also vary. Then the health will tally up at the end of both turns and if either or both you and the boar are less than 0 health, then the one 
        who lived wins!

    <h3> Do you think the health ratios and the damage you do and take is fair? </h3>
    <img id="JeskoAttack" src="txtadvntre_images/boarattack/txtadventureboarattack3.PNG" alt="The code I wanted feedbacked">
        <p> Steffen: Yes its fair but also challenging as well which is a nice touch especially for our backlogs <br>
            Jackson: Yeah it's alright it's hard for the first time though not knowing what you should do next <br>
            Henry: Sure but it does seem a bit hard at the beginning with the amount of health the boar and you have. </p>

                <div id="spacer" ></div>
    <h3> How about the game itself. Is it easy to play or is it a bit difficult on what to do? </h3>
    <img id="JeskoAttack" src="txtadvntre_images/boarattack/txtadventureboarattack3.PNG" alt="The code I wanted feedbacked">
         <p>Steffen: Fight is good and understandble but you should add the short options into this so it's easy as it is 
            a bit repititive and easily boring. <br>
            Jackson: The fight is simple but I have mentioned this already about having to add A, B and C as options 
            but it's not very clear if you can use that here as it only says Attack, Defend, Run and so on. <br>
            Henry: I understand but I think adding A, B and C options would be cool for easier gameplay </p>

        <p> Based from the feedback, I will impliment the A, B and C options for sure. I also have noticed that I will be reusing
            all this code as this is in a define function and I have no way of currently getting the correct outcome for the code
            that follows the define function so I will impliment that as well. <br>
            Here is how the outcome of the fight will look like: <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <p> If boarattackoutcome = "wins" <br>
            Expected: For this scenario, it should output a string of text saying that you won the fight and now you're eating the
            boar because you're hungry and after this, it leads you to a different scenario at the beach cave. <br>

            <p> If boarattackoutcome = "lose" <br>
                Expected: You will die from the boar attack. Pretty simple and variables "ending" and "ending_scenario" will change
                to the bad ending and the game will end. <br>
