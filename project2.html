        <p>For our end users, we would like to have them be teens around the age of 13 - 16 who enjoy fictional novels/ books who want to make them interactive. For our end users to 
            enjoy our game, we are making it a thrilling and action packed interactive to keep their attention span up as teens have been shown to have horrendous attention spans.
            Also, we want them to play this game through simple and not too long story for when they feel bored or need to do something quickly to keep their dopamine up.

        <h1>Implications</h1>
	 <p><h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <br>
    Aesthetics is about making the outcome look and feel good.
    This is quite challenging and confusing for a Text Adventure game where the game is just a bunch of text to interact with, but we want our game to be different.
    We will achieve this by having Ascii art to help visually narrate the story for us. The Ascii art should be appropriate at the right time of the story. This will also
    help us achieve our goal of making the enemies "scary." Another way we can make it aesthetically pleasing is to change the color of the text during the story. The different
    colors will help visually tell us the mood of what the narration or the text is trying to imply and say to the user. This helps the user feel more engaged with the game and feel
    more attentive and interactive.
<br>

	<h2>Functionality</h2>
    <br>
    Functionality is about ensuring the outcome works as its meant to.
    To achieve this goal, we will test our python code through peer feedback from several other people. This will ensure there is randomness of the events during the testing and we
    can find parts of the game that we would have not found ourselves. We will do these several times as well in order to double check and confirm the Functionality. For our game,
    we want to have a multichoice system and through this, we want to make sure that the Functionality of this multichoice system works flawlessly. We can achieve this by doing the
    testing of the code over and over again as previously mentioned. We also mentioned a randomizer system for the game. We must make sure this works by testing it (over
    and over again) and to check the probability of the randomness.
<br>

	<h2>Usability</h2>
    <br>
    Usability is about making the outcome easy to use.
    So for our game, we want it to be as simple as possible with easy instructions. To achieve this, we will make the instructions, narration and text as clear as possible. This ensures
    that our end users can understand our game. We also said to make it as simple as possible, so we will create a multichoice system so there are no unneccessary guessing on what you can
    and can't do in our game.
